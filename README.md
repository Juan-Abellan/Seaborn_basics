# Seaborn_basics

## Background & Objectives

The goal of this exercise is to analyze a data set of a restaurant with invoices and tips, using Seaborn to plot the results of the analysis.

## Data

We will load an example dataset from the online repository (requires internet).
This function provides quick access to a small number of example datasets that are useful for documenting seaborn or generating reproducible examples for bug reports. It is not necessary for normal usage.

df = sns.load_dataset('tips')

## Tools
For this challenge, we will work with Jupyter Notebook and some Python libraries such as pandas and Seaborn.
